# hello-world
the first thing I've ever done in Jill 2.0
I have been a veterinarian for 24 years. I'm really good at it, but I don't find it fulfilling. To be honest, I never have. I've always known that my mind works in a way that is suited for something else, and so I've enrolled in an 8 week code immersion program. We shall see where this leads! Away from the world of anxious clients and biting patients, I hope! or is that anxious patneitns and biting clients...?
